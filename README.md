## How to Use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type @hug_me_bot on your char, after that type the name of the person that needs a hug (adding a @ is optional), then select your desired emote. The bot automatically swaps spaces on the name to underlines.

## FAQ
* __Why does the bot seems slow to respond sometimes?__  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since i'm  using Heroku's free plan the bot may take some time to wake up after being inactive for 30mins.
* __I need help!__
